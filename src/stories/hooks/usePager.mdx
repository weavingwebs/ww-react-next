<Meta title="Hooks/usePager" />
<Title>usePager</Title>

> NOTE: Usually it is better to use [useUrlFiltersWithPage](?path=/story/hooks-useurlfilters--full-example-with-paging) so the page is remembered when the user navigates away and back to the page (which is a much better user experience).

Simple state based pager.
